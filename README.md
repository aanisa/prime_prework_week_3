# Prime Digital Academy - Pre-Work Week 3 Assignment 

## Topics Covered
* For Loops
* While loops
* Arrays


### This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files:
* arrayIndexConsiderations.js
* arrays.js
* booleanConditions.js
* doWhileLoops.js
* forLoop.js
* logicalOperators.js
* loopsAndConditions.js
* switchDefault.js
* whileLoop.js

Each script has some code ready for you with comments telling you what to write. For example. let's look at 'example.js':

Originally it would have come to you like this:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  // return this new, higher number
} // end tripleThis
```

After doing your work it would look something like the following:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  var answer = number * 3;
  // return this new, higher number
  return answer;
} // end tripleThis
```

All the js files are sourced into index.html.
